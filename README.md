Intent Communication in Delphi: A Practical Example

In this example, Application B (sender) sends a specific intent to Application A (myReceiver), which listens for incoming intents and processes them accordingly. This communication method allows for a clean and modular approach to designing applications in Delphi, enhancing code organization and promoting a separation of concerns between different components. The use of intents facilitates a clear and standardized way for applications to communicate and collaborate seamlessly.
